            <h3> About me</h3>
        </article>
          <article>

            <p> Programming and problem-solving have always been hobbies that I enjoy,
                 from coding game jams to revamping websites and databases for fun. I had years of experience as an 
                 administrative assistant, as an event planner, and as a server, before I went back to college to complete 
                 my dream of earning my <b class=aboutMe>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</b>. 
                 Thanks to this experience and my perseverance I was able to thrive and take on new opportunities in multiple technical positions such as
                 a <b class=aboutMe>machine learning engineering intern</b>, where I was promoted to <b class=aboutMe>team lead</b>, 
                 and hired back on as a <b class=aboutMe>software engineer</b> for a contract project. This summer I had the privilege of leading several team projects from start to finish
                 in a <b class=aboutMe>software engineering fellowship</b>. I took a lot of initiative, working <b class=aboutMe>long hours</b> to teach myself and then<b class=aboutMe> 
                    multiple teams</b>, because that is who I am - <b class=aboutMe>someone who tries their hardest</b>, 
                    always. This is why I have decided to help strengthen my subject knowledge and experience by pursuing a <b class=aboutMe> Masters Degree in Data Science</b>.  </p>

            </article>
            <article>
            <p> I enjoy playing <b class=aboutMe>board games</b> - I am really good at Tiny Epic Galaxies. I also love playing <b class=aboutMe>chess</b> and <b class=aboutMe>Tetris</b>. I met my husband playing <b class=aboutMe>Magic: the Gathering</b>. <3 I also really enjoy <b class=aboutMe>hiking</b> with my <b class=aboutMe>dogs</b> when it is not 108 degrees outside! I have an 18-year-old <b class=aboutMe>kitty</b> named Sammy, and even a <b class=aboutMe>tarantula</b>, too!
                 In my spare time, I assist with transportation for <b class=aboutMe>animal rescue</b>. I have helped coordinate interstate travel connecting pets seeking rescue with their future owners, setting up handoffs via both car and airline travel.
